# Description
 
The [language server protocol](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol) has several implementations for various technologies. Their communication protocols are low level like socket to socket and stdin/stdout. In addition they are targeted at running on the developer machine and not on cloud environment.  cloud-language-servers-container is a wrapper server that can run inside an isolated container. It exposes language servers functionality through web socket and REST APIs. The solution covers exposing the language servers, synchronization of source code, security aspects, isoation, etc.

## Responsibilities
- Converting socket/stdin/stdout/etc. into websocket
- Start and stop LSP specific implementations per project/language
- Sync workspace changes and call LSP protocol relevant notifications accordingly
- Manage security tokens life cycle 

## Requirements
cloud-language-servers-container should run in a JEE container such as [Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/) or [Jetty](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/).
cloud-language-servers-container integration tests require ruby installation (see below). 
For integration with [CloudFoundry](http://www.cloudfoundry.org) there should be an available end point, org and space in CloudFoundry to deploy there the server as a Java application.

# Download and Installation

The server is designed to run in a container dedicated for a single user workspace. Specific language servers should be installed and configured via environemnt variables. For CloudFoundry there is a dedicated [buildpack](https://github.com/SAP/cf-language-server-buildpack) responsible for this setup with support currently for java LSP.

In order to build and run cloud-language-servers-container in CloudFoundry follow these steps from command line:

* Download [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
* Install [Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/)
* Run `mvn clean install`
* Run `cf login` to login to cloud foundry endpoint, org and space
* Run `cf push`
* An application named `lsp` should be created with a running cloud-language-servers-container 

# Development Environment

## Debug the application in CloudFoundry

- Find your IP
- Update environemnt variables in cf: `JAVA-OPTS` (correct the IP) and `JBP_CONFIG_DEBUG` according to https://github.com/SAP/cloud-language-servers-container/blob/master/manifest.yaml#L12-L13. If push is done from another server populate these environment variables using the debugger
- After push to CF run from terminal: `cf ssh -N -T -L 8000:localhost:8000 <app-name>`
- Use your favorite IDE to remote debug localhost with port 8000

## Local Integration Test in Windows
Mocha integration tests are dependent on ruby mock language server.

* Set variables in user env for all variables configured in [travis](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-language-servers-container/edit/master/.travis.yml)
* install ruby using [RubyInstaller](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/)
* `mvn install -Pintegration-test`
  
## Run server locally
  `mvn jetty:run -Pintegration-test`

# Limitations

cloud-language-servers-container is integrated fully in CloudFoundry using [the language server buildpack](https://github.com/SAP/cf-language-server-buildpack). However there is a small gap for full integration on local machine or Docker.

# Known Issues

* Memory footprint for JEE server is substantial when each user workspace gets his own server instance. 
* rsync or websocket interfaces might have better performance than the current HTTP REST (for a setting that require sync)

# How to obtain support
For bugs, questions and ideas for enhancement please open an issue in github.

# To-Do (upcoming changes)

* Coplete travis integration
* Setup official releases
* Make integration tests also work on windows
* Easy automated way to install cloud-language-servers-container together with language servers on local machine
* Remove CloudFoundry specific code
